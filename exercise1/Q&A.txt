 cvMat is the most important function in OpenCV. The program reads the cvMat object by using CvMat* cvCreateMat ( int rows, int cols, int type ). The type could be any pre-define type used the contruction:CV_<bit_depth> (S|U|F)C<number_of_channels>. Then, the elements of matrix could be 32 bits float or CV_8UC3, or others. One element in cvMat may not be a single number. We could use simple input to represent multiple values, then we could describle multicolor channels in a RGB image.
This kind of matrix is made of width, height, type, step and a pointer which points to the data.
Mat is used in C++. We could use:  
   Mat src;
src = imread(argv[1], CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR); 
This kind of instructions to access the image.
  The structure is as follows: 
   typedef struct CvMat
   
{
    int type;
    int step;
    int* refcount;/* for internal use only */
    int hdr_refcount;
    union
    {
        uchar* ptr;
        short* s;
        float* fl;
        double* db;
    } data;
    union
    {
        int rows;
        int height;
    };
    union
    {
        int cols;
        int width;
    };
} CvMat;
